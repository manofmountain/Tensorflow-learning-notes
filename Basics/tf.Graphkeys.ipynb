    "    variables are subset of these). See @{tf.global_variables} for more detailes.\n",
    "    Commonly, all 'TRAINABLE_VARIABLES' variables will be in 'MODEL_VARIABLES', and all 'MODEL_VARIABLES' will be in\n",
    "    'GLOBAL_VARIABLES'.\n",
    "    *'LOCAL_VARIABLES': the subset of 'Variable' objects that are local to each machine. Usually used for temporarily\n",
    "    variables, like counters.\n",
    "    Note: use 'tf.contrib.framework.local_variable' to add to this collection.\n",

    "    Note: use 'tf.contrib.framework.model_variable' to add to this collection.\n",
    "    *TRAINABLE_VARIABLES': the subset of 'Variable' objects that will be trained by an optimizer.See @{tf.trainable_variables}\n",
    "    *'SUMMARIES': the summary 'Tensor' objects that have been created in the graph. See @{tf.summary.merge_all}\n",
    "    *'QUEUE_RUNNERS': the 'QueueRunner' objects that are used to produce input for a computation. See @{tf.train.start_queue_runners}\n",
